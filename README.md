# Log Analyzer

The Log Analyzer project generates synthetic server log data for testing, debugging, and learning purposes. It uses the Faker library to create realistic timestamps, IP addresses, log levels, descriptions, and HTTP status codes. This makes it useful for practicing log parsing, monitoring, and analysis workflows without needing real production logs.

## Features

- Creates fake log entries with date, time, IP address, log level, description, and status code.
- Uses the Faker library to make realistic data.
- Extracts Unique IPs and counts the http codes using regex.
